== Prerequisites

ARM toolchain + make

Basic shell utilities:
  bash, dd, sed, tac, printf, find, etc.

Some usually available aux utilities (could
require separate installation):
 crc32, sha1sum



== Build

Add ARM toolchain and bin/ directory path to PATH.

Run make to build the program.

Generated program 
  build/TESTPGM.pgm

Contents of QSPI
  build/TESTPGM_qspi.bin



== Customization

=== Program name

To change program name edit following two places:

----
Makefile:4:TARGET = TESTPGM
src/main.h:4:#define PROGRAM_NAME    "TESTPGM"
----

=== Makefile

It should generally enough to add your source files and libraries
to Makefile under "# Custom section".
